## Overview
This course is offered by the Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences program in the School of Forest, Fisheries, and Geomatic Sciences within the College of Agricultural and Life Sceinces and the Institute for Food and Agricultural Sciences at the University of Florida. The course has a 5-day intensive workshop frontend designed to give students and attendees an overview of R-Shiny, how to design R-Shiny applications, and how to build R-Shiny applications. The course purposefully discusses both the UI design, focusing on UI design principles and best practices, as well as the server-side backend build. Users will navigate from R-Shiny novices to leaving the intensive-phase with a R-Shiny application to further develop during the design-phase. The longer 1.5 month design phase will facilitate students/attendees exploring further development of R-Shiny applications. This development culminates in an application peer-review and final presentation at the end of the course.
